Title: Tidewritten

Written Statement: This piece is inspired by the beaches I grew up around in Tāmaki Makaurau. The soft, floating circles that shape the text remind me of sea foam, always shifting and never still. It’s a bit like how life feels as a student in Aotearoa right now, uncertain but also full of movement and possibility. I wanted the typography to feel alive, like it's breathing with the tide. For me, this is a quiet reflection of where I come from and where I am now. Rooted in place, shaped by the ocean, and still figuring things out.

Primary Typeface(s): Inter Semi-Bold, Neue Regrade Regular-Italic

AI Blurb: I used ChatGPT throughout the development of my interactive typography project to help write and troubleshoot p5.js code. It guided me in creating animated circle packing, implementing ripple effects, and adding a grainy texture, all while helping me translate visual ideas into functioning code more efficiently.
